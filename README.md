Two mesh types were implemented in this mesh solver. The first one is the generated structured hexahedron mesh, which directly uses the hexahedron bounded by the generated O-H grid generated as structural elements. The second element type is tetrahedron element, which is generated by dividing hexahedron elements into sub elements. The detailed algorithm derivation is discussed by Timalsina & Knepley (2022). The algorith is based on The Karman-Trefftz transformation transforms the airfoil in physical coordinate into a circle in a conformal coordinate.
